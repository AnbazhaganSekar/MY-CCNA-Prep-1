# MY-CCNA-Prep-1
I'm currently preparing for my CCNA 200-301 Exam. During the preparation, I build some labs on various topics of Networking with the help of Cisco Packet Tracer.  I hope, these labs will help you too during your preparations.

LAB 1:
A. In this VLAN LAB, 2 VLANs are created. Black & Blue. S3 & S4 are connected with Trunk Links. 
B. PC0 - PC2 & PC1 - PC3 can communicate across the switches.

LAB2:
A. Static Routes has been setup between Router1 & Router 0.
B. To Communicate between VLAN 10 & VLAN 20, ROAS(Router on a Stick) is implemented.
